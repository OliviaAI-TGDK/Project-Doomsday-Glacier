# Project-Doomsday-Glacier
LOX Drones Firmware

Mission Objective

The LOX Drones Firmware is designed to control autonomous underwater drones tasked with transporting and securing Liquid Oxygen (LOX) pipes beneath the Doomsday Glacier. These drones ensure uninterrupted LOX flow for research stations, deep-sea exploration, and cryogenic energy systems, operating in extreme conditions with AI-driven monitoring, refueling, and transport automation.

Features

Autonomous LOX Pipe Transport: AI-controlled drones handle LOX pipe hauling under subglacial environments.

LOX Level Monitoring: Ensures LOX levels are sufficient for drone operations.

Self-Refueling Capability: Automated refueling logic to maintain operational efficiency.

Operational Status Management: Tracks the status of drone activities including transport, refueling, and idling.

Fault Detection & Alerts: Detects low LOX levels and sends alerts for critical refueling needs.

Code Explanation

import numpy as np
import time
import random

class LOXDrones:
    def __init__(self, drone_id):
        self.drone_id = drone_id
        self.lox_capacity = 500  # Max LOX storage in liters
        self.lox_level = random.uniform(100, 500)  # Initialize with random LOX level
        self.pipe_attached = False
        self.operational_status = "Idle"

__init__: Initializes the drone with ID, LOX capacity, and random starting LOX level.


def attach_pipe(self):
        self.pipe_attached = True
        self.operational_status = "Hauling Pipe"
        print(f"[{self.drone_id}] Pipe attached, ready for transport.")

attach_pipe: Attaches the LOX pipe for transport.


def transport_lox_pipe(self, distance):
        if not self.pipe_attached:
            print(f"[{self.drone_id}] Cannot transport, pipe not attached!")
            return
        print(f"[{self.drone_id}] Transporting LOX pipe over {distance} meters...")
        time.sleep(distance / 100)
        print(f"[{self.drone_id}] Transport completed successfully.")
        self.detach_pipe()

transport_lox_pipe: Simulates the drone transporting LOX pipes under the Doomsday Glacier.


def auto_refuel(self):
        refuel_amount = random.uniform(100, 400)
        self.lox_level = min(self.lox_capacity, self.lox_level + refuel_amount)
        print(f"[{self.drone_id}] Refueled {refuel_amount:.2f} L, current LOX: {self.lox_level:.2f} L")

auto_refuel: Refuels the droneâ€™s LOX reserves when low.


Example Usage

drone_units = ["Drone-Delta", "Drone-Epsilon", "Drone-Zeta"]
drone_objects = [LOXDrones(drone_id) for drone_id in drone_units]

for drone in drone_objects:
    drone.run_operations(random.randint(500, 2000))

Initializes a fleet of LOX drones and runs transport operations.
